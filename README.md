## NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day & Mars Rover Pictures

A React frontend connected to a Node backend is a rock-solid combination for any application you want to build.

APIs are what we can use to supercharge our React applications with data. There are certain operations that canâ€™t be done on the client-side, so these operations are implemented on the server-side. We can then use the APIs to consume the data on the client-side.

The API key used in this application, is stored in a hidden file and the calls are made in the back-end, a measure used to protect the API key to be displayed in the front-end.

In this application I used NASA APIs in two different pages. One is to display the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), which is one of the most popular websites at NASA, each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. The images provided by NASA goes all the way back to 1995, so I implemented two features in this application, one the user can get a picture from a random date and the second option the user can choose from any specific date. 

The other page I used Mars Rover Photo API, this API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars.
